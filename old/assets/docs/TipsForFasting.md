Tips for fasting:

1)Forget about the eating window, it is restrictive and unnecessary. Instead, simply focus on pushing your first meal 4-8 hours after rising. You don’t need to break your fast or end your fast the same time, each day. That is extremely restrictive. The only rule is to push your first meal after rising.

2)Don’t think about fasting. Just go about your day, and understand this is very good for you, and this is what your body is designed to do. Your body will kick up energy through increasing fat mobilization. Going without breakfast isn’t a big deal!

3)Use black coffee or cafe americanos (my favorite is Fasting Fuel), strategically to blunt appetite. One really powerful trick is to wait at-least 1-2 hours before utilizing black coffee. This will increase the appetite suppressing effects. Also, I recommend only using caffeine during the fasted state and at no other time. This will ensure your body maintains a sensitivity to caffeine.

4)Drink some sparkling water during the fast to increase fullness and to dissolve any hunger.

5)Break your fast with 1-2 pieces of fruit. The first sign of hunger, typically, is a depletion in liver glycogen. So if you break your fast with some fruit, you can stave off hunger for a couple more hours, with only 80-160 calories. Pushing your first meal later, will make dieting easier!

6)When it comes time to eat, listen to your body. You don’t want to be hungry during the feeding window. In the past, I was too strict on my diet, with intermittent fasting, and it only backfired. Contrarily, if you’re full, it’s okay to go lower in calories if you’re satisfied. You’ll just lean up faster!

7)Eat foods that really fill you up and satisfy you on your calorie intake. For me, this is plenty of meat, veggies, potatoes, pop chips and really good quality milk chocolate.

8)You don’t have to have 2-3 conventional meals. You can have one main meal and some smaller snacks. You can be very flexible with the diet. It’s okay to eat right before bed, it will not interfere with fat loss at all.
